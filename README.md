# Note Taker

This is an app hosted on heroku for keeping track of notes.

After navigating to the notes page from the index there is a pencil button in the top right hand corner to erase current text in both the title field and the text field.

Once both the text field have been filled out the save button will appear that will allow you to save the note to the database and appear on the left hand panel.

Saved notes can be deleted by clicking the trash can to the right of the saved note
